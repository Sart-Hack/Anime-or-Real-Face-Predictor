# Anime-or-Real-Face-Predictor

The website is a simple, modern, and responsive tool for predicting whether an image is of an anime character or a real person. It uses fastai deep learning models and gradio to power the prediction API. The user can select an image from their device and submit it to the website, which will then send the image to the API for prediction. The prediction result is displayed on the website, including the label (either "Anime" or "Real") and the probability of the prediction.
